README of RXTX fork on https://github.com/cardonr/rxtx

rxtx replaces the entire Java Communications API (CommAPI).  Every effort is made to conform to CommAPI but the package name has been moved from javax.comm to gnu.io.  
See https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-communications-api.html

This fork (https://github.com/cardonr/rxtx) is a initiative to make RXTX compatible with Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops: the original RXTX library has several issues preventing the use of serial port redirection with Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops. An example of application based on RXTX is Ultra Prologic CARDS.

Current status: beta (working) version. 

To develop this fork, we studied the documentation "Serial Communications in Win32" of Allen Denver, published in 1995. A copy is available here: https://www.tetraedre.com/advanced/serial/msdn_serial.htm
According to this document "Polling is, of course, neither efficient nor recommended."
We replaced polling by event based programming. This not only improves the performance (CPU usage is reduced), but also makes the Citrix serial port redirection operational.

Other issues with Citrix (tested only with Workspace App for Linux) are:
- The WaitCommEvent Win32 API function returns ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER. Using an event listener is not supported.
- Multiple calls to the SetCommState Win32 API functions with varying parameters is badly supported. One reported issue is the RTS signal not being ON while the hardware flow control is enabled. The workaround is to only call the function once with all correct parameters, or to close and open again the port (still to be tested).

To analyze which Win32 API calls are done by any program, we suggest the use Rohitab API Monitor

Compared to the original RXTX, this fork has a limited subset of functionalities:
- only Windows is supported (removed support for Unix and MacOS)
- only serial port is supported (removed support for parallel port, RS485, I2C, ...)
- receive threshold, receive timeout, and receive framing are not supported. For input stream, the default Java behavior is implemented: attempt to read at least one byte (a read blocks until at least one byte is read.)
- build process based on Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (or Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019)
- support for JDK 1.8 (previous versions are not supported anymore)
- Add support for DLL loading using JNLPAppletLauncher (required for backward compatibility with the CARDS application that uses a modified version of RXTX). See https://jogamp.org/applet-launcher/www/

For commercial support of this fork, I suggest you to contact the company IDS4U (https://www.ids4u.be/) having a strong experience in such projects.
Note that IDS4U is not responsible for the content of the present fork.

TO DO:
- remove print of debugging data to output stream or error stream
- disable debugging parameters by default
- replace printf by sprintf (to prevent buffer overflow)
- remove the use of termios interface (it was a bad idea to make an implementation of Windows based on termios: the API of Windows is completely different; using a bridge for termios increase the complexity and risk of bugs.)
- remove unused code for better readability
- check and fix error handling. Ensure errors are correctly thrown from C code to Java, and exploitable by the application.
- make ThreadedBufferedInputStream resilient to IO error: error should be reported in the error stream (but limit the number of logged errors to avoid flooding the console) and should be ignored with a sleep time (doesn't throw an exception), assuming that the consuming application is controlling the integrity of the data.

KNOWN ISSUES / LIMITATIONS
- Read only one byte at a time (performance issue). This is due to lack of support for the timeouts according to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/ns-winbase-commtimeouts 
	If an application sets ReadIntervalTimeout and ReadTotalTimeoutMultiplier to MAXDWORD and sets ReadTotalTimeoutConstant to a value greater than zero and less than MAXDWORD, one of the following occurs when the ReadFile function is called:
	If there are any bytes in the input buffer, ReadFile returns immediately with the bytes in the buffer.
	If there are no bytes in the input buffer, ReadFile waits until a byte arrives and then returns immediately.
	If no bytes arrive within the time specified by ReadTotalTimeoutConstant, ReadFile times out."
  During our tests with VirtualBox and Citrix, this assertion is not validated: "If there are any bytes in the input buffer, ReadFile returns immediately with the bytes in the buffer." ReadFile doesn't return until the buffer was completely full.
- No support for event listener. This is due to the WaitCommEvent Win32 API function returning ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER.
- Only COM1 to COM4 is supported. This limitation was added to avoid too verbose logging when tracing is enabled.
